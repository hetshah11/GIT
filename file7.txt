If you create patches for the destination branch, you will be provided with two separate patch files, one for the first commit and one for the second commit.

For example, let’s say that you have your “master” branch and a “feature” branch that is two commits ahead of your master branch.

When running the “git diff” command, you will be presented with the two commits added in your feature branch.
